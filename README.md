Skullwalls
==========

Skullwalls allows you to create unique online player head walls.

Walls update on an configurable interval, or as needed.

You can create online walls which list the head every player that is online.
You can create banned walls which lists the head every banned player.
You can create radius walls that lists the head of every player within a defined radius of the wall.

Skullwalls supports AFK and vanished players, using Essentials and VanishNoPacket API. 

Skullwalls is currently heavily integrated with the Bukkit API. Revisions are needed to decouple the core functionality so that this project can be easily ported to new server platforms in the future.
