Skullwalls
==========

Skullwalls allows you to create unique online player head walls.

Walls update on an configurable interval

You can create online walls which list the head every player that is online.
You can create banned walls which lists the head every banned player.
You can create radius walls that lists the head of every player within a defined radius of the wall.

Skullwalls supports AFK and vanished players, adjusted acordingly. 

Skullwalls is currently heavily weaved in with the Bukkit API, a massive overhaul is needed to centralize the core function of the project, and move bukkits implementation outward so that it can be updated for a new server mod in the future.
