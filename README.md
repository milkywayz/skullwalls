Skullwalls
==========

The idea of SkullWalls is to integrate a physical, visual player face "board" which is interactive. 

Players can click the heads to see who's skin it is displaying. 

Administrators can configure the plugin to update regularly (in seconds). 

Administrators can also integrate in custom "action" bindings to tools!

You can bind any tool to execute a command with a player as the parameter in the config file. 

An excellent tutorial of how to use the plugin can be found here (thanks to Variation Vault):
